Class 2 - [Ben] 2) Canary testing (théorie + lab)
##########################################################

In this class, we will deploy App Protect with several methods. We will start with a manual method building the Docker images, and we will finish with a full CI/CD pipeline workflow.

.. note:: At the moment, this lab does not cover the deployment of NAP in a Linux host. It covers only Docker deployment. You can use Frida's UDF blueprint to know how to deploy NAP in Linux host.
